# Pet-Tracker
An IoT-system that will be implemented in my home during the summer of 2025. The system will be designed to keep my dogs safe and healthy. It will use GPS, RFID, and WiFI to provide real-time location tracking, geofencing, and activity monitoring. The system will alert me if my dogs leave a designated safe zone or enter forbidden zones.
